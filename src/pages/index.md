    In narratology, a monomyth is defined as the “hero’s journey.” Monomith’s
    philosophy is that each and every one of us can be the hero of our own
    story. Whether one has yet to realize that, or they have already started on
    their journey, Monomith wants to get everyone on the path and stay on the
    path.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
